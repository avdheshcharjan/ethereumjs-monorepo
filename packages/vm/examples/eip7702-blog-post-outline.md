# Blog Post Outline: Implementing EIP-7702 in EthereumJS - The Future of EOA Superpowers

## Introduction
- Brief explanation of what EIP-7702 is and why it matters
- The problem it solves - UX challenges with EOAs vs. smart contract accounts
- Announcement of EIP-7702 support in EthereumJS libraries

## Understanding EIP-7702
- Detailed explanation of EIP-7702 and its mechanism
- How it allows EOAs to delegate to smart contract implementations
- The authorization process and transaction structure
- Security model and considerations

## Benefits of EIP-7702
- Transaction bundling for better UX
- Gas efficiency by combining multiple operations
- Removing the need for separate smart contract wallet deployments
- Compatibility with existing tools and infrastructure
- Flexible authorization schemes (single-chain, cross-chain)

## Implementation in EthereumJS
- Overview of changes made to the EthereumJS libraries
- New transaction type for EIP-7702
- How the VM processes EIP-7702 transactions
- Verification and code delegation process

## Example Use Cases
